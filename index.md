## Proforma invoice Portal

This is a development project of a Web Portal to create a proforma invoice based upon Service Delivery outcomes

Web Portal System for the automated creation of a pro-forma invoice by extracting info via client’s Service Management Platform API to consolidate info regarding incidents resolved, service requests completed and monthly fixed billing line items onto the resulting PDF document which is then uploaded to client’s billing system for validation and ingestion.

---

### Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a web portal based on Django to facilitate the creation of customer proforma invoices. The invoices will be generated based on:
* Data retrieved from the customer call logging system.
* A set of predefined fixed line items outlined in the client's managed services contract.
* Automatic formatting and uploading of proforma invoices to the customer portal in a format compatible with SAP for seamless ingestion.

This solution will streamline and automate the invoicing process, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and ease of use for both internal users and customers.

### Project Scope

#### In Scope:

* Development of a Django-based web portal with authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
* Integration with the customer call logging system to retrieve service-related data.
* Implementation of a module for managing fixed line items from the managed services contract.
* Automated proforma invoice generation in PDF/HTML formats.
* Automated formatting of invoices for SAP ingestion (e.g., XML, CSV, IDoc, or other required formats).
* Automatic upload of invoices to the customer portal for SAP ingestion.
* User interface for reviewing, modifying, and approving invoices before finalization.
* Data storage and retrieval using a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
* Logging and audit trails for invoice modifications.
* Deployment on a cloud-based or on-premises infrastructure with security best practices.

#### Out of Scope:

* Full billing automation beyond proforma invoice generation.
* Integration with external payment gateways.
* Advanced analytics or reporting dashboards beyond basic invoice logs.

---

### Key Deliverables

* Functional Django-based web portal for invoice generation.
* Secure authentication and authorization system.
* API integration with the customer call logging system.
* Fixed line item management module.
* User-friendly invoice creation and approval workflow.
* Automated PDF/HTML invoice generation.
* Automatic formatting and uploading of proforma invoices for SAP ingestion.
* Deployment and production readiness documentation.

---

### Assumptions and Constraints

#### Assumptions:

* The customer call logging system provides an accessible API or database connection.
* Fixed line items do not frequently change and can be stored statically or managed in the application.
* The users have defined roles for invoice creation, review, and approval.
* The customer SAP system can ingest invoices in a specified format.
* Secure API or file transfer method is available for uploading invoices to the customer portal.

---

#### Constraints:

* Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable).
* Limited development timeframe (to be defined by stakeholders).
* Budget restrictions affecting infrastructure choices.
* Format and upload method must align with customer SAP requirements.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| API downtime or unavailability | Medium | High | Implement caching and error-handling mechanisms |
| Data inconsistencies between systems | Medium | High | Implement validation rules and reconciliation processes |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | High | Enforce security best practices, conduct penetration testing |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Define clear requirements and scope from the outset |
| User adoption issues | Low | Medium | Provide user training and clear documentation |
| SAP integration issues | Medium | High | Validate format with SAP team, conduct early testing |
